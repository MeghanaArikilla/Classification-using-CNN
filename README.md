# Classification-using-CNN
CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. I create an Image classifier to classify images as cat, dog, frog etc., To achieve our goal, we will use one of the famous machine learning algorithms out there which are used for Image Classification i.e. Convolutional Neural Network(or CNN). So basically what is CNN – as we know it’s a machine learning algorithm for machines to understand the features of the image with foresight and remember the features to guess whether the name of the new image is fed to the machine.
